  [Multimodal-Fake-News-Detection](https://github.com/sarashahin/Multimodal-Fake-News-Detection)
  
  I examined different deep learning architectures for text classification such as Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional encoder   representations from transformers (BERT). As a multimodal approach, I proposed a CNN architecture that combines both texts and images to classify the       fake news.
