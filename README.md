  [Multimodal-Fake-News-Detection](https://github.com/sarashahin/Multimodal-Fake-News-Detection)
  
  I examined different deep learning architectures for text classification such as Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional encoder   representations from transformers (BERT). As a multimodal approach, I proposed a CNN architecture that combines both texts and images to classify the       fake news.

  [text-classification](https://github.com/sarashahin/Textclassification/blob/main/text-classification.ipynb)
  
  
Trained a Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Network (with LSTM layer) methods to carry out classification of Ironic and Sarcastic Tweets using      Natural Language Processing. Pre-processing of the text data and word vectorisation was required before training these methods using TensorFlow.          Evaluate the methods' performance based on Precision, Recall, and F-Scores.

[Diabetes_Retinopathy_Dectetion_UNet_augment](https://github.com/sarashahin/DiabetesRetinopathyDectetion_UNet_augment./blob/main/DiabetesRetinopathyDectetion_UNet_augment.ipynb)

The unet_model function defines the architecture of the U-Net model using a series of convolutional, pooling, and transpose convolutional layers. The model takes an input tensor of shape input_shape and returns an output tensor of shape (height, width, 1).
